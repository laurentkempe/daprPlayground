# Dapr Conversation building block

As developers, we often find ourselves tied to specific providers. The same applies to Large Language Model (LLM) providers. This can limit our flexibility and control over our applications. In this blog post, we’ll explore how to decouple ourselves from LLM commodities by leveraging Dapr’s Conversation building block. This approach allows us to switch between different LLM providers seamlessly, ensuring that our applications remain adaptable and future-proof.
